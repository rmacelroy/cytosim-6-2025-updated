 A static radial array of filaments, with motors moving inward

 Enabling `fast_diffusion` can make the simulation a bit faster when there
 are a lot of Couple, but another reason to use this is that it also makes 
 the model simpler, since the fraction of bound/free can be then calculated
 analytically.
