% A simulation to test the relationship between:
%   - the tension in a ring of filaments,  
%   - the radial force exerted on the Space by the filaments.
% The two should be proportional at equilibrium, following Laplace law or some similar rule
% Here with a system that is rotational symmetric around the Z-axis:
%
%     sum_of_radial_force_components = 2 * PI * tension
%
% However, noise makes this hard to see in many cases
