% Here, multifunctional motors are build using a rigid mini-filament backbone,
% % and these mini-filaments can then crosslink two longer flexible filament,
% which are clamped at their ends. This scenario is used to study force production
% in actin networks where the force generators are myosin mini-filaments.
