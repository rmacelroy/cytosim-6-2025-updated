# Parameters

Most parameters of the simulation are distributed in their object.

The parameters associated to a class are contained into an associated `property` class. For example the paremters of `Fiber` are in `FiberProp`.

All parameters are briefly documented directly in the code.

This material is also summarized in the code documentation:
