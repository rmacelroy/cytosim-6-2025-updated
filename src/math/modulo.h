/// Modulo is a helper class used to implement periodic boundary conditions
/**
 This class implements periodic boundaries conditions for Vector,
 in all dimensions and selectively to only some of the coordinates: X, Y or Z.
 
 We follow the method B (Do not restrict the particle coordinates) described in
 [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodic_boundary_conditions)

 In this way, we can tell the movements of the filaments, and track all paths
 without any loss of information. Attention: our origin is in the box center,
 unlike on Wikipediaâ€™s description.
