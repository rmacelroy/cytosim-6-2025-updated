     The `time_step` is the amount of time between two consecutive simulation states.
     It controls the precision of the simulation, at the expense of computation.\n
     We expect that the numerical result will converge to the true mathematical solution
     of the equations when `time_step` becomes infinitely small, but we do not necessarily 
     know how fast this convergence will be. Thus it is not usually possible to 
     calculate the precision as a function of the `time_step`.\n
     To check that `time_step` is appropriate for a particular problem, one should 
     always run several simulations where `time_step` is varied systematically.
     
     Useful rules:
     - A smaller time step is always preferable, provided that the time to run the simulation
     remains acceptable,
     - You should always check that the results of two simulations with <em>time_step=h</em>\
     and <em>time_step=h/2</em> are identical. If this is not the case, then `h`\
     is most likely not an appropriate value for `time_step`,
     - If some reaction in the simulation occures with a rate R, then `time_step`\
     should be such that <em>time_step * R << 1</em>. In practice `time_step * R` should not be higher than 0.2.

     Note that non-linear effects are not taken into account in Cytosim. Hydrodynamic effects are also neglected, such that the drag coefficient of a collection of objects is simply the sum of the individual drag coefficients. However, an `effective` viscosity can be set for each object class, and with this option, it is possible to adjust the drag coefficient of the collection to a realistic value.

     This parameter can affect the performance greatly, and it is always a good idea
     to try the different possible values of `precondition`:
     - 0 : do not use preconditionning
     - 1 : use an simple banded preconditionner that is quick to calculate
     - 2 : use a symmetric isotropic block, derived from the full matrix of the system
     - 3 : use a isotropic block, derived from the full matrix of the system
     - 4 : use the diagonal block of the full matrix of the system
     - 5 : same as case `4`, converted to another format optimized for SIMD AVX.
     .
     
     Preconditionning is a technique to speed up convergence of iterative methods,
     that can be used to solve the movements of the Mecables in Cytosim.
     It relies on finding a matrix (the preconditionner) that is approximately
     equal to the inverse of the matrix of the system we want to solve.
     Using a good preconditionner should reduce the number of iterations
     needed to converge to a solution, resulting in a potential overall speedup.
     
     However, calculating the preconditionner itself is costly, and performing
     one iteration with preconditionning is also more expensive than without.
     This generally results in a complex tradeoff, and performance will vary.
     In some cases, using a preconditionner can even degrade preformance,
     in particular if some objects have many vertices.
     
     The different preconditionners represent different tradeoff:
     the approximation is improved from 0 to 6, but the CPU cost also increases.
     
     If there is only one filament in the system, `precondition=0` should perform best.
     With many filaments, trying `precondition = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6]' is a good strategy.
     This can be performed automatically by setting 'solve=auto' in the 'run' command.

     close enough to interact, based on a dividing the Space with a rectangular grid.
     
     `steric_max_range` defines the minimum size of the cells in the grid.
     A finer grid reduces false positives, but increases the amount of memory used
     by the grid, and the number operations needed to establish and clear the grid.
     
     Thus optimal performance is usually obtained for an intermediate value of
     `steric_max_range`. However `steric_max_range` must remain greater than the
     maximum interaction distance, otherwise some interacting pairs will be missed.
     Experimentation is usually necessary to find the best value.
     
     The maximum distance at which an object may interact with a sibling is its
     diameter. Generally, `steric_max_range` should be greater or equal to the
     sum of the radiuses, of any two objects that may interact.
     In the case of fiber, the `interaction-radius` is a combination of the
     segmentation, and the radius: std::sqrt( (4/3*segmentation)^2 + 4*radius^2 )

     with a grid of rectangular cells of size `binding_grid_step` (see FiberGrid).
