 Set below POOL_UNATTACHED = N to pool N successive Hand's attachment trials.
 The effective diffusion coefficient and binding rates are increased to compensate.
 This can be advantageous since FiberGrid::paintGrid() is spared for N-1 steps

     The binding to a fiber is allowed only if the keys of the Hand and Fiber match.
     The test uses a BITWISE_AND operation of the two keys:

         if ( fiber:binding_key BITWISE_AND hand:binding_key )
             allowed = true;
         else
             allowed = false;

     Thus, with `binding_key = 0` attachment is completely disabled, and in general
     one needs to look at the bit-pattern of the keys in base 2, to determine if two keys are compatible.
     For example, `1` [binary: 01] can bind to `3` [binary: 11]  but not to `2` [binary: 10].

     where FORCE is the norm of the tension in the link holding the Hand,
     and `unbinding_rate' and `unbinding_force' are two parameters.
     By setting `unbinding_force=inf', unbinding is made independent of load.
