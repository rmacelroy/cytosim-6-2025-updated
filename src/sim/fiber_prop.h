     The bending elasticity modulus `rigidity` has units of pN * um^2,

     absolute temperature (kT = k_B * T):

         abs_real( L / N - segmentation )

     the expected magnitude of the forces experienced by the filament:

     Generally, a simulation should not be trusted if any filament contains kinks
     (i.e. if the angle between consecutive segments is greater then 45 degrees).
     In that case, the simulation should be redone with a segmentation divided by 2,
     and the segmentation should be reduced until kinks do not appear.

     Hence attachement is disallowed if the two `binding_key` do not share any common digit
     in base 2. For most models, one can use powers of 2 to distinguish fibers:
     - microtubule: `binding_key = 1`,
     - actin: `binding_key = 2`,
     - DNA: `binding_key = 4`,
     - etc.

     However, more complex combinations can be created by using all the bits of `binding_key`.
     With the example above, a Hand with `binding_key=3` can bind to both `actin` and `microtubule`,
     but not to `DNA`.
